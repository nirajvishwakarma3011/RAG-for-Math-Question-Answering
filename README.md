# RAG-for-Math-Question-Answering
This repository contains a complete pipeline for experimenting with mathematical reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). It facilitates the comparison of **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and hybrid approaches using Llama-3.1-8B and OpenMath2 models.
